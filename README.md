Gist
====

This program is meant to be a simple, plain text, terminal application used to store ideas and information like a sketchbook. 

There is not much to say right now, as I've only written one class, GistIO. 

The classes I am currently contemplating making are:
GistMarkup - this takes Gist objects.
If the object is passed to GistMarkup as a Gist object, then the class tags the contents
of the object so that it can be saved to a plain text file. 
If the object is passed to GistMarkup from a File object, then it removes tags and assigns the contents of the File to a Gist
object.
